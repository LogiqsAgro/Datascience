# Quarterly goals

## 2022 Q2

### Two-week projects

Our goal is to do multiple small projects to:

* Get hands-on experience with data-science and AI.
* Learn quickly how to conduct these kinds of experiments.
* Generate content that can help us grow our network,
  by attracting curious data scientists in our field of interest.
* Learn how to collect the right data from our logistic- and growing systems.
